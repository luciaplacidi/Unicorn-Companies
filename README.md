# Unicorn Companies Data Visualization

## About the Data
The analysis was based on a dataset from Maven Analytics for their April 2022 challenge. The goal for this analysis is to
illustrate the current landscape of unicorn companies around the globe, presented in a single-page dashboard.

The dataset contains a csv table with 1,074 records, one for each company.

I started by making a list of questions that would help with the analysis:

1. Which companies had the biggest ROI?

2. How long does it take to become a unicorn?

3. Which countries have the most unicorns? Are there any city industry hubs?

4. Which industry has the highest average valuations?

5. How many companies become unicorns each year?

## Data Prep and Analysis
* Remove rows with "Unknown" funding values
* Cleaned Valuation and Funding columns and changed data type.
* Created a new column for Year Founded and changed data type.
* Created calculated columns for Return on Investment and Years to Join.

## Key Findings
* It takes a company an average of 7 years to become a unicorn.
* Fintech, Internet Software, E-Commerce & DTC, and Artificial Intelligence have the largest total valuations out of all industries.
* The number of Unicorns joining has been increasing, with a % increase from 2020 to 2021.
* San Francisco, New York and Beijing can be considered industry hubs.
* Average Return on Investment was 1031% across all companies.
